# Lyricify

## Description
This is a simple app written using React-Native designed to display song lyrics. It will be designed with consideration for both IOS and Android. This project is purely for learning purposes around best practices and what frameworks/tools to adopt moving forwards.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`, this will install all dependencies
3. You will need to sign-up for a [developer.musixmatch.com](https://developer.musixmatch.com/) account and create an app for a unique API key. Paste your API key into the `./src/configs/core.js` file
4. Run `npm run build:ios` to build and start up the app in your ios simulator
5. Run `npm run build:android` to build and deploy to a running device or emulator
